# first_java_project
This project utilizes the Spark framework to create a simple web application which allows users to add posts to a dashboard page. 
Maven was used as a build tool for this project, and Handlebars was used as a templating engine. This project does not have an implemented database but a list which is appended when a post is made.
My next project will use an ORM to store posts in a SQL database.
